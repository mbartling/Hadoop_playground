title: Eos Getting Started Homework Assignment
---

## Problem 1
First read through the [Eos Intro Guide](../22/EOS-Intro.html "The trick is in the Gotchas") and [Example PBS Breakdown](../22/pbs-breakdown.html), where you will find a couple of key steps to configuring your EOS login to run Hadoop. Second make a directory in your home called *Homework*. Next, make a copy of the TAMU SC example *hadoop.job* script ( /g/software/hadoop/tamusc/hadoop.job ) and put in Homework directory. Modify this PBS script such that it submits a job called "First_Hadoop_Demo" to the cluster, and sends you an email indicating the job is complete.

Once you have familiarized yourself with this file, run it with

```
$ qsub hadoop.job
```

And monitor it with 

```
$ qstat
```

The SC cluster should email you indicating the job is complete. After running the example hadoop job, check the output of the generated files.

```
$ ls 
```

The output should be hadoop.job-o{$PBSJOBID}

## Problem 2
Write your own Word Count MapReduce method using your favorite scripting language. After testing your WC, modify the hadoop.job script to submit WC to the cluster. First test it with a small arbitrary text (up to you to pick one), and once you are confident in your WC, try running it with [this text file](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1661/1661.txt).


## Problem 3
The scripted Friends of Friends reduce algorithm is missing from my documentation. Make your own FoF reducer, test it functionally, then submit the job to the cluster.

I have provided a way of generating friends lists on my github.


## Problem 4
The NOAA National Oceanographic Data Center website contains many files ranging from a few megabytes in size, to multiple gigabytes. Suppose, for research purposes, you need to perform some statistics on some [climatological data](http://www.nodc.noaa.gov/OC5/3M_HEAT_CONTENT/climatology.html). Write a couple of map reduce programs to **calculate the arithmetic mean and standard deviation** of the **monthly** climatological temperature fields, and test it on the cluster. This can be done with either one or multiple map reduce methods (the choice is up to you).


The data can be retrieved from: http://www.nodc.noaa.gov/OC5/3M_HEAT_CONTENT/climatology.html 

Be sure to save the larger files to your $SCRATCH or $TMP directory!



## Happy Coding!
