## Special Thanks
Special thanks to Jack Perdue and the Texas A&M Super Computing Cluster Folks for all of their super-computing-related help! Not to mention letting an undergraduate engineer play around with the most powerful computer he has ever seen. I owe you guys cupcakes.

Also, a very special thanks to Dr. Sunil P. Khatri and George W. Wood for your extensive mentorship with this project! I owe both of you a stack of cupcakes!
